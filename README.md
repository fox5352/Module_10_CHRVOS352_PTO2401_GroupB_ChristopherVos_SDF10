## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[Application Programming Interface is a piece of code that forms an abstraction layer between the user and the software, enabling users to perform tasks without having to code everything themselves. An example of an API I've used would be the WebAPI in the browser.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[An interface is a shared boundary across which two separate components of a computer system communicate. An API, on the other hand, is akin to a 'hatch' to a machine]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[The main purpose of an API is to provide a toolset for performing tasks without the need to code them from scratch. There are various types of APIs, such as Web APIs, which are servers designed to provide data and services. Some common standards include RESTful APIs and SOAP APIs. Additionally, there are other types like SDKs (Software Development Kits) ie firebase, which are collections of code that assist users in programming lower-level functionalities without having to implement them manually.]

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[I am on Linux, so I am familiar with cURL, and I've used Thunder, a VSCode extension, for API interaction.]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[I am confident in my ability to create APIs. However, I feel less comfortable with naming conventions such as RESTful and creating effective SDKs]
